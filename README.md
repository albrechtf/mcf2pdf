# mcf2pdf Converter for Mein CEWE Fotobuch (My CEWE Photobook) files to PDF

## Development discontinued

Hey all, thanks for all your GitHub stars and downloads :-) As you can easily see from the change dates of the files, the development of mcf2pdf **is stalled** - at least here, in the original repo. Mainly because of lack of time on my side and too many recent changes in the MCF format.

As I can see from many bug reports and requests, mcf2pdf (in this version) may not work at all with recent MCF files.

But hey, there are alternatives!

* There are some forks, check them out! On the upper right, click the number behind "Fork". [This fork](https://github.com/rbodziony/mcf2pdf) tried to fix at least some common issues, but has also not been updated for several years now. Other people may still continue to work on their fork.
* If you are a developer, you could fork this repo and update the software yourself.
* Personally, I appreciate the new "cloud service" https://www.cewe-myphotos.com/. Here you can upload your photobooks and share them with others even before printing - exactly **that** was my main motivation to create mcf2pdf (to get feedback before printing). So the need for a software like mcf2pdf is much lower - at least on my end.

If you have or create a good (working) fork of mcf2pdf, feel free to let me know (e.g. via an Issue in this project), and I will link you in this README.

If you are interested in the previous README file here, you can find it now at [README.old.md](./README.old.md).
